# Bruce JavaScript SDK Wizard
This package includes an interactive wizard to help you set up a JavaScript application for Bruce Zero.

## Getting started
Create your application using the interactive wizard:
```shell
npx create-bruce-app@latest
```

Then, enter the directory with your application and launch it:
```shell
cd my-bruce-app
npm run start
```

You are free to use `pnpm` or `yarn` instead of `npm`.
